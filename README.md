# Parallel_Resolution
Rapid developments of multi-core processors in the last ten 
years have accelerated the advancements in concurrency platforms. 
Performance of bottom-up resolution algorithms used in logic 
programming and artificial intelligent systems, can potentially be 
improved using the parallel programming constructs offered by these 
platforms (e.g., OpenMP, Cilk++, etc.). In this work we use Cilk++ to 
implement a parallel bottom-up resolution algorithm, and study how 
different parallel programming constructs affect its performance. 
Our experimental results show that a careful Cilk++ implementation 
of the algorithm can lead to significant speedup w.r.t. its 
traditional serial implementation. This repository contains our 
test case, an implementation of Wumpus World navigator agent using cilk++.
